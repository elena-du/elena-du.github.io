title: The beauty and the curse of APIs.
---

Before pivoting to data science I was working a lot with startups, developers and data enthusiasts. And I remember distinctly the confusion of the most talented mathematician and technology enthusiast when somebody asked him a question: "What is actually an API exactly?". There are things in the world that seem so obvious to people who deals with them daily, but, at the same time, those things are hard to explain to people outside of the field. API (Application Programming Interface) falls into this bucket. So, if you are struggling to understand the concept and are far from programming at all, the first part of the article is for you. If you are looking for a practical example and welcome some Python, the second part of the article is waiting for you. The truth is, APIs are best understood as an exercise.



[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) is a static site generator, an open-source tool for creating simple yet powerful websites of all shapes and sizes. From [the project's readme](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/blob/master/README.markdown):

> Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory [...] and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server. This is also the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host your projectâ€™s page or blog right here from GitHub.

It's an immensely useful tool. Find out more by [visiting the project on GitHub](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll).
