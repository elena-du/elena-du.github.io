  Hi there! It is a perfect time to read a Data Science Blog. 
</p>

It is strange times, everyone is a generalist thanks to Google search and everyone is a Data Scientist, at least a little tiny bit. I celebrate the democratization and demystification of topics centered around data. I talk about the details of my projects that are listed [here](https://dubova.net) and about connections of data science to everyday life.

I plan to support 2 tracks:

* Sweet details: practical posts about things I learn as I do my projects.
* Data and Life: somewhat philosophical posts on how data and society are intertwined.

Learn more and contribute on [GitHub](https://github.com/elena-du).

## What's going on

* My passion is teaching and I am constantly looking for ways to improve my teaching practice.
* I plan a new project on latent depression identification. 
* At the moment I'm reading [Chaos by James Gleick](https://read.amazon.com/kp/embed?asin=B004Q3RRPI&preview=newtab&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_wGvsFb43H12HZ)
* I'm studying Mandarin and I find this language fascinating.
* I'd love to join a dynamic and growing team of data enthusiasts.

Do you want to chat about these things? Feel free to [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/poole/poole/issues/new) or [ask me on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elenadubova/).

Thanks for reading!
